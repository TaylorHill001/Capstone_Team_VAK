~# Breakout Game in Python

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based recreation of the classic arcade game **Breakout**. The game will feature:

- **Colorful Blocks**: Blocks for players to destroy with the ball.
- **Bouncing Ball**: A dynamic ball that interacts with blocks, walls, and the paddle.
- **Player-Controlled Paddle**: A responsive paddle to keep the ball in play and target blocks.

Our goal is to deliver a fun and nostalgic experience suitable for players of all ages who enjoy classic arcade-style games.
